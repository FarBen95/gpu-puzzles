# GPU Programming Puzzles

This repository contains my solutions to the GPU programming puzzles from [GPU-Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles). These exercises use NUMBA to map Python code to CUDA kernels, providing hands-on experience with GPU programming.

## Puzzles Solved
1. Adding 10 to each element of a vector
2. Element-wise addition of two vectors
3. Handling more threads than positions
4. 2D array operations
5. Matrix multiplication and more

## Acknowledgments
I want to thank [Mr. Sasha Rush](https://github.com/srush) for providing these engaging and educational puzzles.
